# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
A detailed analysis of survived passengers and their characters. Titanic dataset is always fantastic to work and play with.

Through this dataset various insights regarding the survival of passengers, their corresponding characters are well studied. Using various Algorithms to find the best accuracy score and then evaluating those scores are more interesting part. Different accuracy level from different algorithms shows their different approach in fittin gthe dataset.

I thank Niklas Donges for the detailed insights on Titanic data.
